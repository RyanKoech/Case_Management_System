# Case_Management_System
Descriptiom
Simple program to help manage court system processes part of my Diploma in Business and Information Technology course project.
It is meant to allow easy apploading up evidences on to a database (in this case text only), management of the chargesheet, scheduling of future cases and generate a report on the case.
There are 4 user roles, accussed/accuser, jury, defense attorney and prosecution each with their seprate menus and functions.

Two additional jar files are required
  1. javax.mail.jar - for sending email https://javaee.github.io/javamail/
  2. mysql-connector-java-5.2.49.jar in the scr folder

NOTE: YOU NEED TO TURN NO 'Allow less secure apps in the security settings of the email address' in order to send email with the specified email address.

This code was written in my earlier stages of learning to program and hence pardon me for some approaches but its does what it was meant to. There is currently not styling of the UI.
